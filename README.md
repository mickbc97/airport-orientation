For aid in deciding the angle of a new airport runway.

TLDR: Weather data is found and analyzed to suggest the angle of the new airplane runway that is to be built in Nuuk, Greenland.

## Problem
The current runway is too short for larger airplanes, like Air Greenland's Airbus A-330-300. Negotiations were held on whether a new airport should be built in Nuuk, the current Nuuk runway should be extended, or the airport in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, should be kept. The committee decided the current Nuuk runway should be extended, as it would pay itself back overtime as many passengers' final destination is Nuuk.

The airport project: https://kair.gl/en/nuuk

The area in which the new runway will be built is already decided and the length required is 2200 meters with a width of 45 meters.

The range of angles possible in the currently alloted space will be calculated, and public weather data from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) will be analyzed to determine the ideal angle of the runway under the assumption that maximum headwind is desired.

## Weather Data


## Assumptions and shortcomings
There are many more factors that go into building a runway that were not considered for this small project.
- Only a runway width of 45 meters was considered. In the future, the amount or frequency of sidewind could be considered in determining whether a greater width is desirable.
